<h3> COLLEGE LIFE </h3>
<P> As a sophomore at the University of Georgia, I am currently pursuing my <b> Bachelor's Degree 
in Fashion Merchandising </b> within the College of Family and Consumer Sciences. My area of study was 
one of the main reasons I decided to travel ten hours from home to attend college. Aside from academics,
I am involved in several organizations and programs on UGA's campus. My various involvements can be 
seen in the table below. </P>

<P> My family is very proud of all my accomplishments thus far at the University of Georgia. In fact, here 
is a quote from my mother, Kathy: </P>
<blockquote> "Even though Mary Kate is ten hours away from home, I am so proud of what she is doing 
to be an involved member in the UGA community. She is active in her sorority, and participates in 
both the social and philanthropic aspects of Alpha Gam. She is also involved in a few other organizations
and clubs, as she is always on-the-go with a busy schedule. I am very proud of her!" </blockquote>

<h3> POST-GRADUATE LIFE </h3>	
<p> Although I have more than two years until graduation, I have already begun to ponder where my life
will take me in the future. Most likely, I will return to Washington, DC to pursue my first job and live 
at home while working. After a few years at home, I hope to move to New York City and further pursue
my fashion career in one of the world's major fashion cities. Wherever my future takes me I will always 
be proud to be a <span style="background-color: #FF0000"> Georgia Bulldog! </span> </P>
